# CausalLearning
This package combines two other causal learning packages, pycausal and causallearn, in order to have ease of access to multiple causal learning algorithms.

Dependencies:
- Pandas
- Causallearn
- Pycausal

## DISCLAIMER:

This package is not complete and pycausal, as well as its associated causal learning methods, is still being implemented.

### Algorithm Notebooks

Currently there are 3 working notebooks:
- PC (Causallearn)
- GES (Causallearn)
- FCI (Causallearn)

These notebooks use the dataset COVID3_4Nodes3.dat in the sample_data directory. 

If you have any further issues in determing how these notebooks operate or how their internal functions work, it is highly encouraged you check out the original packages documentation, which can be found below.
